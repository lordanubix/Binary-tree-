# Binary-tree-

In this example, we define a Node struct to represent each node in the binary tree. The InOrderTraversal function recursively performs an in-order traversal of the tree. In the main function, we create a simple binary tree and then call the InOrderTraversal function to print the values of nodes in in-order sequence.Feel free to modify this example or let me know if you have a specific algorithm or modification you'd like assistance with!
